# Experiment 0031: Gemma 4 E2B IT Android QNN/HTP

## Status

**Active before QNN conversion. The public w4a16 checkpoint is fully hash-bound and QAIRT 2.49.40 is now authorized, acquired, and privately extracted. Its implicated converter sources are byte-identical to 2.49.0, so the prior transform defect remains; work is proceeding through an isolated schema-faithful converter compatibility fix. No transformed graph, QNN conversion, compiled context, Android execution, or HTP result exists yet.**

This experiment is a separate HTP arm for the model studied in `0025`. It does not rewrite or relabel the CPU/GPU evidence there.

## Selected route

The already-installed `/home/moritz/opt/qairt/2.49.0.260730` contains unusually strong first-party support evidence:

- its release notes explicitly add the Gemma 4 family;
- it ships a Gemma 4 E2B Genie configuration with `backend.type = QnnHtp`;
- that configuration names one weight-sharing AR128/AR1, CL8192 serialized context and separate embedding/per-layer-embedding LUTs;
- its compiler API explicitly supports `chipset:SM8550` (HTP v73);
- it contains the Android Genie runner and QNN/HTP runtime libraries.

Qualcomm AI Hub Models v0.61.0 identifies a calibrated w4a16 checkpoint archive in its public model-asset store:

```text
https://qaihub-public-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qai-hub-models/models/gemma_4_e2b_it/v1/gemma_4_e2b_it_w4a16.zip
```

The archive was downloaded and inspected while holding `artifacts/locks/heavy-ram.lock`: 2,013,959,998 bytes, SHA-256 `ed45053c8582f2646fb8dd80e0d8f55a462394199160bade96401615b6ce84a7`. ZIP integrity passed. Its 9,119,006,720-byte `model.data` is exactly covered by 724 external initializer ranges from `model_dynamic.onnx`; the archive also binds w4a16 encodings, tokenizer, template, and configuration. See [`results/checkpoint-analysis/result.json`](results/checkpoint-analysis/result.json).

The selected tokenizer produces 170/594/1929 tokens for short/medium/long. Rendered prompt bytes match the prior Gemma route, but token IDs do not; this experiment binds its own tokenizer hashes and does not reuse 0025 token counts.

## Rejected shortcut

The newer public Google Q4_0 GGUF identifies `general.architecture=gemma4`. QAIRT 2.49's direct GGUF-to-HTP support table contains Gemma, Gemma 2, and Gemma 3 but not Gemma 4. Treating that route as supported would weaken the provider and architecture gates, so it is rejected.

## Historical conversion blocker and active route

A bounded, lock-protected support probe resolved `chipset:SM8550` to HTP v73, but QAIRT's high-level GenAI factory has no `Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration` dispatch and returned its generic builder with an explicit unsupported-architecture warning. With the public checkpoint left unchanged and only a copied encoding file supplied, the smallest faithful transform request—AR1+AR128, CL4096, one unsplit graph, no embedding or LM-head split—failed before QNN conversion:

```text
ShapeInference → ConstantPropagation → visit_node_Constant
→ get_constant_np → producer.attributes["value"]
KeyError: 'value'
```

No conversion or compilation was requested after this exact unsupported-graph failure. Post-failure hashes prove that ONNX, external data, and encodings remained unchanged. See [`results/transform-blocker/result.json`](results/transform-blocker/result.json) and the retained raw logs.

Moritz has now authorized the third route. Qualcomm Package Manager access and the `Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_SDK` license are active; QAIRT 2.49.40 was acquired as a 2,410,405,384-byte QIK with SHA-256 `ef4a63b81c9b3a42b8c23921a322754b2fa15f7ef5737c85911d4c527c1fdb0c` and extracted outside Git. The factory and implicated optimizer sources are byte-identical to 2.49.0, while selected Android Genie/QNN/HTP runtime binaries changed. See [`results/qairt-2.49.40-capability/result.json`](results/qairt-2.49.40-capability/result.json).

The exact next gate is a bounded transform-only rerun using an isolated compatibility fix for ONNX Constant attributes that preserves the checkpoint bytes. Only after a hash-bound transform succeeds may QNN conversion and SM8550 compilation begin. Workbench compile/link remains a separate unapproved cost/terms checkpoint. Ad hoc checkpoint graph rewriting, a CPU response, or the unsupported Gemma4 GGUF route is not acceptable.

## Proof boundary

A text response alone will not count as HTP evidence. Before a phone run, this experiment must bind:

1. public checkpoint and every generated artifact by size and SHA-256;
2. SM8550/HTP compilation metadata for the serialized context;
3. exact tokenizer, model-native template, rendered prompt, and token IDs for all tiers;
4. a runtime `QnnHtp` configuration and physical HTP host/stub/v73 skeleton/profile evidence;
5. a complete transformer-graph acceptance boundary with no QNN CPU backend or undocumented transformer fallback.

Tokenizer/template rendering, LUT lookup or requantization, greedy sampling, detokenization, and host orchestration are expected CPU-side boundaries and will remain explicit.

After a bounded viability gate, a canonical campaign is permitted only with one loaded route and proven request isolation. Phone/ADB work requires Pi's explicit priority handoff and `phone.lock` for the entire lifecycle.
