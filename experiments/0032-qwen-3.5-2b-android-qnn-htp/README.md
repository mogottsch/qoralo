# Experiment 0032: Qwen3.5-2B Android QNN/HTP

## Status

**Active. A new ExecuTorch explicit-state route has passed a bounded host QNN compile gate, removing the former “no converter implementation” boundary. The exact 2B checkpoint is not compiled yet, and no Android or physical HTP execution claim exists.**

This is a separate HTP feasibility arm. It does not change or relabel `0027` CPU evidence.

## New route milestone

[`tools/qwen35_qnn_model.py`](tools/qwen35_qnn_model.py) expresses full-attention KV cache and Gated DeltaNet recurrent/causal-convolution state as graph I/O. This avoids mutable-buffer fallback and makes logical-request reset explicit. It also keeps Softplus as one edge operator and maps it to QNN's HTP-supported `ElementWiseNeuron(SOFTPLUS)` operation.

A one-layer synthetic-geometry gate compiled for `SM8550` / HTP v73 as one QNN subgraph: 151 tensor-compute operators were delegated and none remained outside QNN. The compiler finalized and serialized a 110,432-byte context; the generated PTE stays local-only. See [`results/executorch-qnn-structural-probe/result.json`](results/executorch-qnn-structural-probe/result.json).

This proves only architecture-route viability. The graph used tiny deterministic synthetic weights, ran on the x86 host compiler, and produced no Android text. Exact-checkpoint compilation, physical HTP execution, output sanity, and the canonical campaign remain open.

## Cheapest credible route assessment

Qualcomm's public `Qwen3.5-2B` release at revision `bd885dfceb1a1f45564aef4cd69e183085ea9a24` publishes exactly one deployment route: `GENIEX_LLAMACPP` with an Unsloth Q4_0 GGUF. The pinned artifact is 1,214,873,856 bytes with SHA-256 `cd70221bebaee0503e0f6717e174250cd7825aa88438b3aabec9ad55731d9bb1` and identifies its architecture as `qwen35`.

That is not a usable QNN path with the authorized installed tooling:

- QAIRT 2.49's direct GGUF builder supports `qwen2` and `qwen3`, but not `qwen35`.
- QAIRT separately dispatches `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` to an HTP ONNX builder, but that route requires a quantized ONNX graph and encodings.
- Qualcomm AI Hub Models v0.61.0 ships only README/manifest/performance/release metadata for `qwen3_5_2b`; there is no `model.py`, `export.py`, `quantize.py`, public ONNX+encodings checkpoint, or QNN context.
- The installed Qwen3.5 builder hardcodes a 4096-wide start point grouped by 256 and explicitly says to update it when variants have different dimensions. Official 2B geometry is 512 for full-attention KV and 2048 for linear keys. Applying the 4B specialization would be unsupported.

Downloading the 1.2 GB GGUF cannot change this architecture-support result, so the expensive download was correctly avoided.

## Bound frontend contract

The pinned official tokenizer/template was reconstructed independently. With thinking disabled, canonical short/medium/long prompts contain 174/597/1926 tokens and all fit a 4096-token context with the 2048-token ceiling. Rendered prompt and token-ID hashes are in [`protocol/experiment-contract.json`](protocol/experiment-contract.json) and [`results/support-assessment/result.json`](results/support-assessment/result.json).

## Current next gate

1. Download and hash-bind the pinned official Qwen3.5-2B checkpoint outside Git.
2. Convert its text weights with the pinned ExecuTorch mapping and verify eager equivalence for explicit state.
3. Compile the exact 24-layer route for SM8550/HTP v73, retaining zero non-delegated tensor compute.
4. Only then stage a bounded phone viability request under `phone.lock`, with physical QNN RPC/accelerator/cycle/HVX proof and verified cleanup.
5. After viability, implement loaded-route request reset and run the fixed 1+5+5+5 campaign.

GenieX llama.cpp NPU metrics, the shipped 4B HTP example, direct-Hexagon output without QNN, and CPU-only text output are not substitutes for physical QNN/HTP provider proof.
